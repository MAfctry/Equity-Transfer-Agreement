		(b)	Buyer agrees to simulate the calculation of the Tangible Net Worth based on the data in the Reference Balance Sheet and attach such calculation as Exhibit 2.04(b).  The Estimated Tangible Net Worth and the Closing Tangible Net Worth shall both be calculated pursuant to the method of calculation as reflected in Exhibit 2.04(b).
2.05.	Closing Balance Sheet.
(a)	As promptly as practicable but no later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer (with the assistance of the Company and Seller to the extent reasonably required by Buyer) will cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller a balance sheet of the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the “Closing Balance Sheet”), and a certificate based on such Closing Balance Sheet setting forth Buyer’s calculation of the Net Indebtedness as of the close of business on the Closing Date (“Closing Net Indebtedness”) and of the Tangible Net Worth as of the close of business on the Closing Date (“Closing Tangible Net Worth”).  The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in conformity with IAS, without regard to any immateriality provision included in IAS, and to the extent consistent with IAS, the accounting principles used in connection with the Reference Balance Sheet and the accounting principles of the Company as used in its audited financial statements for the past years, which are recognized by Pricewaterhousecoopers, particularly with respect to inventory, accounts receivable and fixed assets depreciation reserves.
(b)	If Seller disagrees with Buyer’s calculation of Closing Net Indebtedness and/or Closing Tangible Net Worth delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(a), Seller may, within forty-five (45) days after delivery of the documents referred to in Section 2.05(a), deliver a notice to Buyer disagreeing with Buyer’s calculation of Closing Net Indebtedness and/or Closing Tangible Net Worth and setting forth Seller’ calculation of Closing Net Indebtedness and/or Closing Tangible Net Worth.  Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which Seller disagrees, and Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Balance Sheet.
(c)	If a notice of disagreement shall be delivered by Seller pursuant to Section 2.05(b), Buyer and Seller shall, during the thirty (30) days following such delivery, use their best efforts to reach agreement on the specifically disputed items or amounts in order to determine Closing Net Indebtedness and/or Closing Tangible Net Worth, as the case may be.  If, during such period, Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter retain the Accounting Referee to promptly review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Net Indebtedness and/or Closing Tangible Net Worth, as the case may be.  In making any such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Balance Sheet or Buyer’s calculation of Closing Net Indebtedness and/or Closing Tangible Net Worth, as the case may be, as to which Seller has disagreed.  The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth each such calculation.  Such report and the Accounting Referee’s determination of Closing Net Indebtedness and/or Closing Tangible Net Worth, as the case may be, shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller.  In no event shall Closing Net Indebtedness as determined by the Accounting Referee be higher than the amount thereof as calculated by Buyer in accordance with Section 2.05(a) or lower than the amount, if any, thereof as calculated by Seller in accordance with Section 2.05(b).  In no event shall Closing Tangible Net Worth as determined by the Accounting Referee be lower than the amount calculated by Buyer in accordance with Section 2.05(a) or higher than the amount, if any, calculated by Seller in accordance with Section 2.05(b).  The cost of the Accounting Referee’s review and report under this Section 2.05 shall be borne by Buyer and Seller in proportion to the difference between the amount proposed by each of Buyer and Seller and the amount determined by the Accounting Referee.  For example, if the Closing Tangible Net Worth calculated by Buyer and Seller is 700,000 and 1,200,000, respectively, but is determined to be 1,000,000 by the Accounting Referee, Buyer shall be responsible for 60% of the cost of the Accounting Referee’s review and report (i.e., (100-70)/(120-70) x 100%) and Seller shall be responsible for 40% (i.e., (120-100)/(120-70) x 100%).  
(d)	Buyer, the Company and Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause their respective independent accountants to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing Net Indebtedness and/or Closing Tangible Net Worth, as the case may be, and in the conduct of the audits and reviews referred to in this Section 2.05, including, without limitation, making available to the extent reasonably required books, records and work papers.

(B)	and is also less than Estimated Tangible Net Worth, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the difference between Closing Tangible Net Worth and Estimated Tangible Net Worth.
(ii)	If Closing Tangible Net Worth is more than RMBMMMM , but the Estimated Tangible Net Worth is less than RMBMMMM Buyer shall pay an amount by which the Estimated Tangible Net Worth is less than RMBMMMM to Seller; provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, (i) if the Estimated Net Worth Adjustment Amount is zero, Buyer shall not be obligated to make any payment pursuant to this Section 2.06 and (ii) under no circumstance shall Buyer’s payment pursuant to this Section 2.06 exceeds the Estimated Net Worth Adjustment Amount.
(b)	Adjustment based on Closing Net Indebtedness

(ii)	If Closing Net Indebtedness is more than Estimated Net Indebtedness, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the difference between Closing Net Indebtedness and Estimated Net Indebtedness.  
(c)	Any payment pursuant to Section 2.06 (a) or (b) shall be made within ten (10) business days after the Closing Net Indebtedness and Closing Tangible Net Worth have been determined in accordance with Section 2.05.

The parties hereto agree that (i) the provision of products or services to the Company by Seller or its Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or such contracts entered into prior to the execution of this Agreement as listed in Schedule 11.01(a) or any written agreement that may be entered into between the Company and Seller or its Affiliates after the Closing Date shall not be deemed a violation of this Section 11.01(a) during the term of such agreement; (ii) if any Affiliate of Seller becomes a non-Affiliate of Seller at any time during the non-competition period set forth in this Section 11.01(a), Seller shall not be responsible under this Agreement for any activities of such non-Affiliate thereafter.

Nothing in this Agreement shall diminish the rights of Buyer regarding the protection of Trade Secrets and other intellectual property pursuant to applicable Law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confidential Information does not include any information to the extent such information was already in the public domain as a result of Buyer’s misconduct or the misconduct of the Company after the Closing, or such information was duly provided to Seller and its Affiliate by a third party not subject to any confidentiality obligation, or such information was publicized with written authorization by senior management personnel of Buyer on behalf of Buyer or the Company, or such information was independently developed by Seller or its Affiliates as long as the developer of such information has never had any access to the Confidential Information.
(d)	Seller agrees to cause each of those persons who are listed in Schedule 11.01(d) but have decided not to become an employee of the Company to enter into a non-competition agreement with the Company on the Closing Date, in form and substance substantially similar to Exhibit 11.01(d), undertaking that, for two (2) years from the Closing Date, such person will not engage in any activity that is in competition with the business of the Company in any manner or position (including but not limited to as a shareholder, partner, director, employee, consultant, agent, distributor, etc.).
(e)	If any provision contained in this Section shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Section, but this Section shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.  It is the intention of the parties hereto that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable under applicable Law, this Section shall be construed and interpreted or reformed to provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under such applicable Law.  Seller acknowledges that Buyer would be irreparably harmed by any breach of this Section and that there would be no adequate remedy at law or in damages to compensate Buyer for any such breach.  Seller agrees that Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive relief requiring specific performance by him of this Section, and Seller consents to the entry thereof.

The change of the legal representative and members of the board of directors of the Company shall take effect at the Closing and shall be filed and registered with relevant examination and approval authority and registration authority of the Company after the Closing.  Seller and Buyer shall fully cooperate to effect such change.  When this Agreement is submitted to relevant examination and approval authority for approval, if such examination and approval authority requests that Buyer and Seller issue appointment letters for the directors of the Company, Buyer shall appoint the existing directors appointed by Seller to continue to act as the directors of the Company prior to the Closing Date.  After the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall promptly apply to relevant registration authority for the registration of the changes in the Company’s legal representative and the board of directors.

The Option may be exercised under the following circumstances and within the following period (collectively, the “Exercise Periods”) by delivering to Seller a written notice (the “Option Exercise Notice”): (i) at any time after the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date to 180 days after the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date ; or (ii) at any time after the occurrence of a material breach by Seller of this Agreement (including without limitation a breach of Seller’s representations and warranties in Section 3.02), the Joint Venture Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements (if an Affiliate of Seller is a party to an Ancillary Agreement, a material breach of such Ancillary Agreement by such Affiliate shall be regarded as a material breach under this Section 11.07(a)(ii)), or any other agreement to which Seller is a party or is subject and which are related to the business and operation of the Company, which breach constitutes a Material Adverse Effect; or (iii) within 180 days after Seller delivers to other shareholders of the Company notice to terminate the Equity Joint Venture Contract pursuant to Section 15.1 of the Equity Joint Venture Contract (or such corresponding section of the then prevailing Equity Joint Venture Contract of the Company).
			(ii)	Buyer and Seller agree that (i) if the 10% Interest is diluted after the Closing Date as a result of Seller’s decision of not participating in (that is, not making contribution in proportion to its ownership percentage in the Company to) the increase of the registered capital of the Company, the Option Purchase Price will not be reduced therefor; and (ii) the Option Purchase Price may be reduced pursuant to Section 12.05(v) hereof, that is, an amount equal to the shortfall amount that shall be paid by Seller to Buyer or its Affiliate as set forth in Section 12.05(v) shall be deducted from the Option Purchase Price.
(b)	Seller’s Right to Require Purchase.  Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Buyer hereby grants Seller a right to require Buyer to purchase the 10% Interest at the Option Price at any time during the Exercise Period by delivering to Buyer a written notice  (“Purchase Request Notice”).

(ii)	Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and the Company to secure all governmental approvals and registrations necessary for the consummation of the transfer of the 10% Interest within 120 days after the application for transferring the 10% Interest has been filed to the appropriate governmental authorities.
(iii)	Buyer and Seller shall each pay its respective taxes as required by law in connection with the transfer of the 10% Interest to Buyer.
(iv)	Buyer and Seller shall each do and perform all such further acts and things and shall execute and deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents as the other party may reasonably request to give effect to the transfer of the 10% Interest to Buyer in accordance with the terms and intent of the Equity Transfer Agreement.
(d)	No Offer or Sale to Third Party.  Within the  period set forth in Section 11.07(a)(i) above, Seller shall not sell or offer to sell to any third party the 10% Interest without Buyer’s prior written consent, which consent may be withheld in Buyer’s sole discretion.
(e)	Transfer to Overseas Affiliate.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.07(d), Seller may, after the Closing, transfer the 10% Interest to its Affiliate incorporated outside the PRC, provided that neither such Affiliate nor any of such   Affiliate’s shareholders is in a business that competes with the business of the General Electric Company, and Buyer hereby gives its consent to and waives its preemptive right with respect to such transfer, provided that: (i) Seller will continue to be subject to all the obligations, covenants and responsibilities (including but not limited to the non-competition covenant set forth in Section 11.01 hereof) hereunder and under the Equity Joint Venture Contract, to which Seller is subject to before such transfer, as if Seller was still a party hereto and thereto; and (ii) Seller shall enter into a written agreement with the overseas Affiliate, the Company and Buyer to expressly set forth the provision in the preceding sentence.

(a)	If any third party asserts a written claim or files a lawsuit (a “Third Party Claim”) against the Company or Buyer or Buyer’s Affiliate (an “Indemnified Party”), and the Company, Buyer or its Affiliate believes that it has the right under this Agreement to request indemnification from Seller (the “Indemnifying Party”) for any losses incurred therefrom, then the party who receives the notice of such Third Party Claim shall give prompt written notice (the “Notice”) to the Indemnifying Party, together with the relevant information with respect to the Third Party Claim. .

(b)	Except as otherwise provided in Section 12.03(c) and Section 12.03(d), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within 30 days of receipt of the Notice, to consult or settle with the third party, or assume and conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party.  At the reasonable and proper request of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall issue a power of attorney as necessary to grant the Indemnifying Party and its counsel appropriate authorization in defending the Third Party Claim.  If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 12.03(b), the Indemnified Party may continue to defend the Third Party Claim.  If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim as provided in this Section 12.03(b), the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, provided, however, that if the Indemnifying Party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may assume its own defense, and the Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable costs or expenses paid or incurred in connection therewith.

(c)	The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall have the right to participate in (but not control), at its own expense, the defense of any Third Party Claim which the other is defending as provided in this Agreement, provided that, the two parties shall fully consult with each in advance to ensure that one Party’s action will not cause damages to the other Party’s interest.

(d)	The Indemnifying Party, if it shall have assumed the defense of any Third Party Claim as provided in this Agreement, shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Claim (i) which does not include as an unconditional term thereof giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party a complete release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (ii) which grants any injunctive relief or (iii) which may reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the affected business of the Indemnified Party.  The Indemnified Party shall have the right to settle any Third Party Claim, the defense of which has not been assumed by the Indemnifying Party, provided that, the Indemnified Party shall have promptly delivered notice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim and have received within five (5) days after its delivery of the notice a written reply from the Indemnifying Party confirming that the Indemnifying Party will not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim; if the Indemnified Party has not received a written reply from the Indemnifying Party with said five (5) days, then the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have decided not to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim.

(e)	Whether or not the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

12.04.	Procedures for Direct Claim.  In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim for indemnity against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver a written claim notice to the Indemnifying Party.  If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article XII, or the amount thereof, the claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under this Article XII, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion of the claim) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion of such claim) becomes finally determined.  If the Indemnifying Party has disputed its liability with respect to such claim as provided above or the amount thereof within thirty (30) calendar days following its receipt from the Indemnified Party of the claim notice, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 14.02.
12.05.	Source of Payments.  Payments to be made for purposes of satisfying claims for indemnification hereunder by Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall be made in the following manners: (i) first from the Escrow Amount upon Buyer’s notification to the Escrow Agent; (ii) if for any reason the Escrow Amount is insufficient for payment pursuant to Section 12.02, Seller shall immediately pay the shortfall amount directly to Buyer; (iii) if Seller fails to pay in full such shortfall amount in accordance with the preceding sub-clause (ii) within five (5) days after Buyer submits a written request to Seller, Buyer shall be entitled to demand and receive such shortfall amount from the Additional Escrow Amount upon notice to the Escrow Agent, (iv)if any shortfall still remains after the foregoing procedure, Seller shall pay such shortfall directly to Buyer; (v) if for any reason Seller fails to pay such shortfall in full to Buyer or its Affiliate, then the unpaid amount shall be deducted from the Option Purchase Price. 
12.06.	No Contribution by the Company or New China.  For the avoidance of doubt, Seller acknowledge and agree that, after the Closing, under no circumstances will the Company or New China be required to contribute to or pay any amount in conjunction with the satisfaction of any claim for indemnification hereunder by Buyer or one of its Affiliates.
12.07.	Limitations on Liability.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement:
	(a)	subject to Sections 12.07(a)(i) and 12.07(a)(ii) below, the total liability of Seller hereunder shall not in the aggregate exceed US$, except that:
(i)	the total liability of Seller in respect of all claims of Nuclear Damages shall not be subject to any monetary or any other limitations; and 
(ii)	the total liability of any party hereto in respect of claims of Damages for fraud or willful misconduct shall not be subject to any monetary or any other limitations.
